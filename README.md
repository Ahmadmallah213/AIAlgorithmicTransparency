# 📘 Algorithmic Transparency: The Cornerstone of Accountability in AI Systems

This repository contains the full research paper I authored as part of an ethics course, focusing on the critical role of **algorithmic transparency** in the ethical deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems.

## 🧠 Abstract

Algorithmic transparency is a foundational principle for ethical AI. This research investigates the limitations of commonly used explainability methods such as SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), and makes the case for adopting more **formal, rigorous explainability techniques**. Drawing on key ethical frameworks—utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, and justice theory—the paper argues that transparency is not only a technical goal but an ethical imperative for fair, trustworthy AI.

## 🧭 Why This Matters

It's critical to comprehend **how** and **why** AI makes decisions in a variety of fields, including healthcare, economics, and law enforcement. This research emphasizes the need for open, responsible, and equitable systems and adds to the larger discussion on ethical AI design.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- SHAP scores, while popular, can be misleading in high-stakes domains.  
- Formal explainability offers consistency, verifiability, and ethical accountability.  
- Ethical decision-making in AI must be grounded in transparent mechanisms.
